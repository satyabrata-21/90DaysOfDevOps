# Day 07 – Linux File System Hierarchy & Scenario-Based Practice
## Today's goal is to understand where things live in Linux and practice troubleshooting like a DevOps engineer.
- Linux File System Hierarchy (the most important directories)
- Practice solving real-world scenarios step by step

## Part 1: Linux File System Hierarchy (30 minutes)

**Core Directories (Must Know):**
- `/` (root) - The starting point of everything
  
What it contains:
- The top-level directory of Linux. Every file and folder on the system starts from here.
  
I would use this whe:
- I need to understand the overall filesystem structure or verify mounted directories.

- `/home` - User home directories
What it contains:
- Home directories for normal users. Each user stores personal files, configs, and scripts here.
I would use this when…
- I need to check a user’s files, SSH keys, or application configs.
  
- `/root` - Root user's home directory
What it contains:
- Home directory of the root (admin) user.
I would use this when…
- I am logged in as root and need admin-level scripts or SSH configuration.
  
- `/etc` - Configuration files
What it contains:
- System-wide configuration files for services, users, networking, and startup settings.
I would use this when…
- I need to configure or troubleshoot services like SSH, Nginx, or system settings.
  
- `/var/log` - Log files (very important for DevOps!)
What it contains:
- Log files generated by the system and services (critical for debugging).
I would use this when…
- A service fails or behaves oddly and I need to investigate errors or access issues.
  
- `/tmp` - Temporary files
What it contains:
- Temporary files created by applications; usually cleared on reboot.
I would use this when…
- I need short-lived files for testing or troubleshooting without permanent storage.

  
**Additional Directories (Good to Know):**

- `/bin` - Essential command binaries
  What it contains:
- Essential command binaries required for the system to boot and run.
I would use this when…
- Basic commands must work even in recovery or minimal environments.
  
- `/usr/bin` - User command binaries
  What it contains:
- Most user-level command binaries and installed tools.
I would use this when…
- I need development tools, networking commands, or package-installed binaries.
  
- `/opt` - Optional/third-party applications
  What it contains:
- Optional or third-party software installed outside the default package manager.
I would use this when…
- Managing manually installed applications like enterprise tools or vendor software.
